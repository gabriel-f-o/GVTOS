# GVTOS
GVTOS is a Real Time Operating System made from scratch by 2 programmers. The aim was to understand the inner mechanisms of RTOS in general

The RTOS was made using an STM32F407VGT and a nucleo board, but the system was designed to be compatible with any ARM Cortex M4 MCU.

This RTOS has the following features :

 * Priority Management
 * Dynamic priority to avoid inversion of priority
 * Ability to wait for multiple objects at once
 * Mutex, Semaphores, Message queue and Event
 * Heap management
 * Object / task creation in run time
